# Collection of Typinator Sets

## Accented Words
This set represents accented words not included in the standard autocorrect or the TidBITS autocorrect file. 

## Contractions
This set represents contractions not included in the standard autocorrect or the TidBITS autocorrect file. 

## Fractions
This is the fractions set from TextExpander converted for use in Typinator. 

## Months and Days
This is the months and days set from TextExpander converted for use in Typinator. 

## Short Words
This set was inspired from a [blog post by Brett Teprstra](http://brettterpstra.com/2017/05/31/minimalist-text-expansions-a-textexpander-experiment/) where he  experimented with text expansion on short, common words such as “the” “another” and “will”. I’ve used many of his suggestions, deleted some I don’t find useful, and added some of my own to this list.
